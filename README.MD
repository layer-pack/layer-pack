# webpack-inherit

Allow :
- Inherit multiple projects directory (in js & scss)
- Do glob require on inherited directory
- Easily override node_modules
- inherit webpack config easily

This plugin is working, but still in beta stage  ( not well tested/optimized for now ),
Samples come here : https://github.com/n8tz/webpack-inherit-sample ( actually the only doc )
